This repository has contents for a small fun project to help me track the contents of my fridge so that I stop wasting my food and letting it go bad...

this is a project to preserve my wallet...and yes there's a pretty decent chance this is updated and is actually what's in my fridge. 

Stored on cloud (firebase) so that i can access it whenever wherever instead of having it locally hosted on my computer.
